//2)Practically prove, After changing the return type overloading happens or not?
//Overloading only depends on different signature
//We can Overload methods having different signatures by changing their return types
//But, we cannot overload after changing only return type and keeping the signature same,
//error by compiler = > add(int, int)' is already defined in 'week2.day9.overloading
//If they donâ€™t have different parameters,
// they both are still considered as same method even though return type is different
// and a compile time error will be generated.
