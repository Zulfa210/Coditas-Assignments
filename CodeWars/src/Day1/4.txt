DESCRIPTION:
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000

Solution:
public class Clock
{
  public static int Past(int h, int m, int s)
  {
    //Happy Coding! ^_^
    int time = s * 1000 + h * 60 * 60 * 1000 + m * 60 * 1000;
    return time;
  }
}
