Tangible or Intangible Asset

Some intangible assets may be contained in or on a physical substance
such as a compact disk (in the case of computer software), legal documentation (in the case of a licence or patent) or film (in the case of motion
pictures). The cost of the physical substance containing the intangible
assets is usually not significant. Accordingly, the physical substance containing an intangible asset, though tangible in nature, is commonly treated
as a part of the intangible asset contained in or on it.

"Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, 
alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a \"natural philosopher\"), widely recognised as one of the
 greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the
 philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
 Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal
 contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal
 calculus.In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant 
 scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description 
 of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession
 of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that
 the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's 
 inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La 
 Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier 
 systems.Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based 
 on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light 
 was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of 
 cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian 
 fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, 
 generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a 
 function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.","M.A. (1668)","Trinity College, Cambridge",
